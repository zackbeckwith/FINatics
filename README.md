# FINatics üêü

FINatics is full-stack web application built using Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. FINatics performs full CRUD capabilities and is able to utilize the JSON Web Token for authorization and authentication. This is my first time taking a mobile-first approach and the app is functional on both mobile phones and desktops

### Who is FINatics for and why does it exist?
 
One of my biggest hobbies is aquascaping, and the art of decorating a fish tank comes with a lot of love and hardwork. I of all people know that owning your own aquarium is one of the most redeeming hobbies there are. You spend an endless amount of time planning out your schools of fish, finding the perfect piece of driftwood, determining the best substrate, acclimating the water perfectly, and so on. Needless to say, it's a lot of work, and you deserve to have that work recognized. 

FINatics is for an app for fish hobbyists who want to brag about their fishy creations and eventually discuss and ask for advice from others on their homemade ecosystems.
