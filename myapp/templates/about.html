        </div>
        <p>
            Owning your own aquarium is one of the most redeeming hobbies there are. You spend an endless amount of time planning out your schools of fish, finding the perfect piece of driftwood, determining the best substrate, acclimating the water perfectly, and on and on. Needless to say, it's a lot of work, and you deserve to have that work recognized. FINatics is for an app for fish hobbyists who want to brag about their fishy creations and eventually discuss and ask for advice from others on their homemade ecosystems.
